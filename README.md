# Predictive_modelling_Customer_trends
Customer segmentation and spending analysis for a retail company employing clustering, regression algorithms, and NLP techniques to extract insights and develop actionable recommendations for potential sales growth strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.


##Background/context of the business scenario

Business problem: Improving overall sales performance by analysing and considering customer trends.

Analytical problem: Identify statistically significant features and segment customers to predict loyalty point balances. 
The project aims to address the following analytical objectives/questions:
1) Identify relevant features that best explain the variance in customer spending behaviour and evaluate possible relationships between features and loyalty point balances to develop predictive models.
2) Group customers based on models' predictions to increase marketing strategy efficiency by implementing tailored marketing campaigns and promotions based on the identified segments.
3) Identify and summarise common themes and opinions in product reviews and evaluate sentiment to improve overall sales performance by addressing customers' needs related to customer service or products

## Dataset

- Online Reviews: full review text submitted by customers and review summary
- Customer Demographics and socioeconomic characteristics (gender, age, education, remuneration)
- Spending Score: a score assigned to a customer based on the customer’s spending nature and behaviour. The value ranges between 1 and 100
- Loyalty Points: a score based on the point value of the purchase, converting the monetary value to point value, and the point value of an action (purchase)
- Product ID: identifies the product associated with the review
- Language of the review and platform source

##Analytical approach

1) Regression algorithms are employed to identify relevant features that best explain the variance in customer spending behaviour and evaluate possible relationships between features and loyalty point balances to develop predictive models
2) Centroid-based clustering model used to group customers into clusters based on similarities
3) Visualisation techniques and summary statistics – to identify patterns and interpret customer clusters, providing valuable insights to inform decision-making
4) Lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool (VADER) specifically designed for social media text and short sentences and Word Clouds – to assess sentiment and summarise most common themes in product reviews.
